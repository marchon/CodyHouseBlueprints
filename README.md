Purpose: 
----
Clone The Cody House GitRepos for Designs and Plans to use on your next project. 

What it does:  Clone this repository - and run 

		git clone https://github.com/marchon/CodyHouseBlueprints.git
		pip install -r Requirements.txt 
		python CloneCodyHouseSubModules.py 

the list of available CodyHouseWeb Github Repos as subdirectories in a directory called 

./CodyBlueprints  you may change this path in the CloneCodyHouseSubModules.py file 



How it works: 
----
It goes to github - extracts a full list of CodyHouseWeb Repos It creates or uses a directory called ./CodyBlueprints to mirror all of their repos into.

If you run the script CloneCodyHouseSubModules.py again - it will download any new repos that have been created. 

This project itself is not a copy of the CodyHouseWebrepos 
---
 It is a tool to help you download and explore their current repos. 
---
!it is a fan project to make it so that you can bring them into your project directories instantly for ideas and inspiration. I wrote it for myself to explore their work and then decided to expand it and share it with others. I hope that you enjoy it.   



 

It will clone the entire list of CodyHouse Project Examples which I called "Blueprints"" 
    
    Information about these projects is available in their rss feed
